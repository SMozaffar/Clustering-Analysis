# K-Means vs. Spectral Clustering

Clustering, a type of unsupervised learning, is used to capture the structure, grouping, and underlying processes immanent in a dataset. The goal of clustering is to separate the data into distinct groups in such a way that data points in the same groups are more similar to each other than data points in other groups. Here, we explore two different clustering algorithms, K-means and spectral clustering, to get an insight to how they work and compare their performance.
